<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

### Inspiration Behind The Project

After observing the recurring nature of certain downloaded files in my daily 
life, I realized a remarkable opportunity to streamline my Downloads folder. 
Recognizing discernible patterns, I embarked on creating a solution that would 
automatically organize these files into their designated folders.

### Features

From workout videos and university documents to piano sheets and applications, my regular downloads encompass a diverse range of content. This project addresses the challenge of manual organization by effortlessly distributing files into their respective categories.

The project goes beyond simple organization. It features a tracking mechanism that records all file-related actions, including movements, renaming, and even files left untouched. This provides a comprehensive view of each edit made to the Downloads folder.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

1) Clone the repo using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/claraz4/Personal-File-Organization.git
```

2) Since this project is designated for personal use and may require customization, feel free to modify the code as you see fit.

3) Once you're satisfied with the changes, run your Python code, and voil√†!

4) If you're getting tired of manually running your code every time you want to organize your folder, consider automating your task by taking advantage of your PC's task scheduler.
